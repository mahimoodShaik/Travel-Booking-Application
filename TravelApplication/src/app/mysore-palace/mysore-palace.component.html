            <h3>Mysore Palace</h3>
            <p>While culturally different, South India is as enchanting as the northâ€”just visit Mysore to see for yourself. The third-largest city in Karnataka is considered to be the cultural capital of the state, celebrated for its high-quality silk, Mysore painting tradition, and hypnotic Hindu temples with deity carvings that nearly touch the clouds.</p>
            <p>Most tourists visit Mysore to see its World Heritage-listed palace. This attraction takes Indian grandeur to the next level, with endless mirrored decor, stained-glass windows, carved wooden doors, and intricate mosaic floors that look like the inside of a kaleidoscope. The palace is considered to be one of the country's finest examples of Indo-Saracenic design. Be sure to swing by to see the palace at night, when it's lit up with thousands of twinkle lights.</p>
